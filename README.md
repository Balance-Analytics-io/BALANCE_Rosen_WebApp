# BALANCE Rosen Bridge Web App
BALANCE Analytics presents an open source alternative Web App UI for Ergo's Rosen Bridge.

[Rosen Bridge](https://rosen.tech/) is an [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) Centric open-source protocol for cross-chain asset transfers. The main benefits are:

- Incentivized Auditing
- Ongoing Monitoring
- Transparent Reporting

Currently, the bridge to Cardano enables Ergo<>Cardano asset transfers for **interoperability**, a key blockchain foundational pilar.

BALNCE's Mission is to provide the Cardano-Ergo Community with accurate, insightful decentralized network data analysis to make informed decisions and maximize success. 

We strive to provide exceptional curated on-chain analysis and data visualization, and become the defacto gold standard for years to come.

Any questions of feedback, DM on Twitter [@BalanceData22](https://twitter.com/BalanceData22) or better yet, come chat in our [Matrix.org Ergo Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#ergo:forum.balanceanalytics.io)
